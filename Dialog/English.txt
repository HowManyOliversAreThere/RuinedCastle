Madeline, this really isn't good
[MADELINE left upset]
Oh, a dilapidated castle collapsing around us isn't a good thing?
Please, tell me more.
[BADELINE right upset]
Look, I told you this was a bad idea, and you did it anyway
[MADELINE left normal]
Are you going to help me figure out a way out or are you just going to keep sulking?

[BADELINE right scoff]
You mean the castle didn't collapse into a perfect staircase for you?
[MADELINE left normal]

Are you ready to apologise yet?
[MADELINE left normal]
If I apologise will you help?
